I have developed quite a few projects over the last few years, varying from discord bots to public libraries to
command-line applications. I've _always_ wanted a space other than Github to showcase them... so here we are. I'll only
be showcasing my _absolute favourite_ ones here, so please check out
my [GitHub](https://github.com/sgoudham?tab=repositories&type=source) to see all of them!

```admonish
The older ones have a _significant_ drop in quality compared to the more recent ones.
```

Alas, here are some of my favourite personal projects! (in no particular order!)

> A robust, customizable, blazingly-fast, efficient and easy-to-use command line application to uwu'ify your text!

### Notes

`uwuifyy` holds a special place in my heart out of all the personal projects I've started. Besides being my first Rust
crate that I published, it was my first time interacting with online developers who wanted to contribute to the
project. (I also think it's my most _professional_ looking project...)

<h2><a href="https://github.com/sgoudham/rall" target="_blank">rall</a></h2>

**_Really...? Another Logging Library?_**

> rall is an incredibly simple and intuitive logger, consider this crate a _failure_ if you can't get setup within **30 seconds!**

### Notes

The name for this project is something I feel like everyone thinks nowadays, with an abundance of logging/monitoring
tools and libraries that we as software engineers have access to. The library itself does not claim to do anything
special or fancy. My goals were to understand API design more and experiment with exposing different APIs and see what
works. It was also a great excuse to delve more into Rust during University time, especially Rust macros.

> Recursive & Iterative Binary Search Tree Implementations within Rust

### Notes

Probably the most frustrating project so far as I'm still very early in my Rust journey and found it quite difficult
_'fighting with the borrow checker'_ to try and code to compile. However, it was fascinating taking a concept I knew
reasonably well and had implemented in other languages... Only to find out that the implementation I had ported over was
inherently _memory unsafe_, so the compiler rejected it. To summarise this project in 3 words, I would say _**
fascinating but frustrating**_.

> A Powerful Music Discord Bot

### Notes

Initially, this bot was created during the "How To Learn A New Language" University course and (tried) to retrieve
player statistics about Overwatch players. It wasn't the best as there was no official API. I eventually took the bot
and started anew with an entirely new goal of a music bot. Winston stands out because it's the first time I created my
own java annotations and used [Micronaut](https://micronaut.io/) for my personal Java projects.

> Utility Library to Access and Manipulate the Default System Clipboard

### Notes

The inspiration for this project stems from my frustration with Macs and how they didn't have the same default clipboard
functionality as Windows. The overall plan was to create a library and then a
GUI ([MyClipboardHistory](https://github.com/sgoudham/MyClipboardHistory)) to interface with it. I learned a lot about
threading and spawning/existing background threads and started to get into API design. Unfortunately, I don't think it's
very robust as Windows 11 has since come out, and I don't think this library works for that.

> An Unofficial Asynchronous Java API Wrapper for MyWaifuList

### Notes

I believe this was my first project that actually exposed an API for clients to potentially use. I remember thinking
about how users would want to use the library, which I had no prior experience. One of the main highlights of this
project was getting to know more about jackson and serializing/de-serializing data into POJO's through annotations. An
enjoyable first project :D

## Final Thoughts

I wouldn't say any of the projects listed above are **that** impressive or mind-blowing, but they all have played a
pivotal role in building up the understanding that I have now.

At the time of writing, I'm at the beginning of my career, and I can't wait to develop further and dive into more and
more rabbit holes that working on these projects allows me to! And, of course, I hope to bring _you_ along for the ride.
Watch this space :D
